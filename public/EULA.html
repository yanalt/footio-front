Grant of License

"Software" means all contents gathered from Mund.io.

Words "Sell", "sale" or "buy", "purchase" are solely related to the transfer of license rights in Software in accordance with this Agreement. Users do not acquire ownership of Software, but only the right to use it in accordance with the present Agreement and applicable agreement between user and the respective publisher (the "Publisher Agreement").

The Software is licensed, not sold. Mund.io grants, and you accept a limited, revocable, terminable, non-exclusive right to use, display and perform the Software for your personal, non-commercial use (unless otherwise allowed pursuant to the applicable Publisher Agreement), provided you comply with all terms and conditions of this Agreement, applicable Publisher Agreement and copyright laws of the country in which the Software was created or from which it may be accessed, international treaties and conventions, and other laws.

Your license confers no title or ownership in the Software. All title, ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Software and any and all copies thereof, are owned by Mund.io and/or its affiliates’ licensors. All rights are reserved, except as expressly stated herein. The Software is protected by copyright laws, international copyright treaties and conventions and other laws.

Mund.io reserves any and all rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement. You agree to refrain from any action that would diminish such rights or would call them into question.

Payment terms

The final cost of Software is determined depending on the payment method and will be brought to your attention after such payment method is chosen.

All purchases of Software require a valid debit/credit card or other payment method that is accepted by Mund.io in its sole discretion.

You claim and warrant that your use of a credit card or other payment method is authorized and that all information that you submit to Mund.io or its 3 rd party payment processor is true and accurate; you agree to pay all fees you incur. Mund.io is not liable for damage of any kind arising from your submission of any information that is deemed to be untrue or is inaccurate.

All charges incurred, and all purchases are payable in advance and are not refundable in whole or in part, regardless of the payment method, except as expressly set forth in this agreement and applicable refund policy.

If your purchase is subject to any type of use or sales tax, then Mund.io may also charge you for those taxes and you agree to pay all fees you incur and taxes if applicable. The European Union VAT ("VAT") tax amounts collected by Mund.io reflect VAT due on the value of any Software.

You agree that you will not use IP proxying or other methods to disguise the place of your residence, whether to circumvent geographical restrictions on game content, to purchase at pricing not applicable to your geography, or for any other purpose. If you do this, we may terminate your access to purchased Software.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mund.io has the right to refuse any payment in its sole discretion without giving explanation.

The minimum and maximum limits of payment may be applied at the discretion of Mund.io. Generally, payments are limited to $5 per single purchase and $1000 in a 24-hour period per User. However, Mund.io reserves the right to modify these amounts based on its experience with a particular User and other considerations (purchase algorithms) that Mund.io applies to purchases.

Payment processing, as well as a refund due to payment refusal, may take some time. Mund.io has no responsibility for any losses arising out of delays in payment processing and refund due to the payment refusal.
